This is intended to be run on a linux system. 
It has been proven to work on Ubuntu Server 20.04.2

This does not have any of the NGINX settings needed to support the server. 
You will need to do that yourself if you are setitng this up.

### To do:

- clean up useless async/await
- set up replica sets for mongodb
- add informational text on homepage
	- note a re-direct does not count
